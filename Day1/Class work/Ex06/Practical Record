Problem specification: Type conversion in java
Implementation:
class Exercise{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		char c1 = 'g';
		System.out.println("The character is :"+c1);
		
		int int1=(int)c1;
		System.out.println("The Character is :"+int1);
		
		double d1=10.09;
		System.out.println("The value is :"+d1);
		
		int int2=(int)d1;
		System.out.println("The value is :"+int2);
		
		double d2 =int1;
		System.out.println("The value is :"+d2);
		
	}
}
Output:
The character is :g
The Character is :103
The value is :10.09
The value is :10
The value is :103.0

Conclusion: The program demonstrates type conversion in java between char,int,and double
