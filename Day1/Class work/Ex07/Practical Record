Practical number:07
Problem specification:Write a java program to perform and display the results of basic arithmetic operations
Implementation:

class Ex07{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		int x=10;
		int y=5;
		
		System.out.println("Addition is :"+(x+y));
		System.out.println("Substraction is :"+(x-y));
		System.out.println("Multiplication is :"+(x*y));
		System.out.println("Division is :"+(x/y));
		System.out.println("Modulus is :"+(x%y));
		
	}
}
Output:
Addition is :15
Substraction is :5
Multiplication is :50
Division is :2
Modulus is :0

Conclusion:Learned how to display and perform of these operartions on two integers.
